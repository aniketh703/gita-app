## 2024-04-21 - [Enforce HTTPS for External Links]
**Vulnerability:** Use of potentially unencrypted `http://` URLs when opening external browser pages or deep linking, which could lead to Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks where data is intercepted or manipulated.
**Learning:** Found two locations (`external-link.tsx` with `expo-web-browser` and `SettingsScreen.tsx` with `Linking.openURL`) where arbitrary or potentially dynamic URLs were not explicitly verified as secure (`https://`). React Native components often just execute what they are given.
**Prevention:** Always enforce HTTPS for external links by verifying/replacing the protocol before passing the URL to system APIs like `openBrowserAsync` or `Linking.openURL`.
